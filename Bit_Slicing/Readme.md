### **Bit Plane Slicing of an Image (MATLAB)**



This MATLAB program performs bit plane slicing on a grayscale image. The image is first converted to grayscale (if RGB), and then decomposed into its 8 individual bit planes to analyze the contribution of each bit to the overall image.



#### **Description**



* Reads an image and converts it to grayscale if needed
* Extracts 8 bit planes (LSB to MSB) using arithmetic operations
* Displays all bit planes using subplots



#### **Application**



Bit plane slicing is commonly used in:

* Image analysis
* Image compression
* Watermarking
* Understanding pixel-level information
